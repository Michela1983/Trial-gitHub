Hi I am Miky, a student in Web Development at Vanier College.
I am currently in my 2nd term.
I am learning TypeScript, Python, PHP, mySQL, Bootstrap, jQuery and so much more...
I don't know yet what I want to do after my studies.
Perhaps Front-End Developer because I enjoy create beautiful websites
